The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike C.,"Very good food
Crab cakes were amazing gourmet
The Philly cheese was very tender and juicy"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Michelle M.,"We've come here a few times, once during happy hour and then once during dinner service on the weekend. Both times, the food has been delicious, perfectly priced, and served with a lot of heart.
I recommend both the Philly Dip and the Steak and Baked Fries.
Happy hour menu is great!"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Kim W.,"Came in for a Seahawks game
Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get. My group ordered wings (which were good), nachos (alright), backyard burger (burnt) and drinks for each of us. Our bill was over $100. Somethings off if they think this will bring people in."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Eric O.,"Love the restaurant interior, staff is friendly, and drink options are plentiful. Some cons for me were pricy food items, small portions, and TVs mounted too high. I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike H.,"Let start off by saying WOW, just WOW!! I have never had a steak salad before and i never knew what i was missing until now. I order the black and blue salad. The salad itself was large and had a good portion of steak on it. The salad was fresh and so were all the toppings. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Medium rare to medium. The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well. I have passed by this place so many times I'm glad i went in and will have to go back."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Amira J.,"first of all, our server mike was so cool n sweet! authentically himself & laid back! he checked on our group often & made sure our water was refilled! it can be hard to feel welcomed by some restaurants especially if you are a black person of color so i just want to say my experience here with the service was amazing!
i met up with my folks here after work around 6. the pub is located at the end of a small lot that's shared with a gas station & a few other small stores. when you walk in it's pretty spacious inside. not really booths but lots of tables n chairs & a bar.
i ordered the large cajun chicken cesar salad 5/5: i was really excited about eating this. the portion of chicken was perfect with the amount of lettuce given. it came with parmesan, & croutons! the dressing wasn't heavy at all & i appreciated this because i was able to feel more refreshed after chowin dooown
overall i had a great experience here & would 100% recommend for happy hour & late dining.
happy hour is from 3-6, 9-close"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Kristy R.,Second time visiting here. The outside looks a little sketchy but inside has a cool vibe! There is parking in the back in case it is completely full in the little area in front. We did not order any food at this visit but did on our last. Food is very good and service is even better! Enjoyed a couple cocktails tonight and listen to live music definitely a cool little joint. The area it's located in is not my favorite though.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Amber Lee A.,"Good food, in a location you wouldn't expect. I drove up to meet a friend and just assumed it was a gas station. I've now been twice and all the items I have tried were very good."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Lena Y.,"Kind of a hidden gem in a strip mall within a gas station. I found this place via a quick Yelp search so my friend and I could grab dinner. It doesn't look very big from the outside, but you walk into a pretty large space with a variety of tables and seating areas. We sat ourselves as a sign instructed us to, and we were greeted by our server Mike. He was friendly, welcoming and energetic. We shared the poutine, and I got the Hellbent coconut stout and backyard burger with a side of broccoli cheddar soup. Cool that all there beers on tap are from Washington!"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Chelsi A.,"Don't judge a book by its cover. I honestly thought it was a small old bar, and if it wasn't for my cousin recommendation I'm not sure we would have gone.
I love the atmosphere, great selection of local beers on tap and DELICIOUS pulled pork nachos; oh man!! I grew up in Renton and will know recommend this place to everyone. We will for sure be back."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Henry L.,"Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends. It's was around 8pm.
Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike S.,"Food was good, beers were cold service was a bit slow but it all worked out. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, fair food portions. Good place to chill."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Deanna D.,"This is the 3rd time I've been here, and I love it! Very personable wait staff, great food selection, and our waiter was charismatic, and very attentive. We had the Brick Philly Dip, and the Black & Blue salad."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Leslie W.,The Brick recently changed their menu again. I miss the Cajun chicken sandwich. I only eat white meat and was glad to have this on the menu. The have since removed it. I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly. Since that sandwich is gone I don't find anything comparable on the menu. Guess I will have to find another Cajun chicken somewhere else.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Stephen G.,"Our second visit to the Brick Pub. First visit a few months back was not bad.
It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed..."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Brad B.,"The Brick is a nice pub with great food, hiding in a gas station parking lot. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is large with lots of seating.
I loved the beer selection at the Brick. They had a whole bunch of local beers that you don't find at many other places, which that alone would keep me coming back.
The food was really good as well! I had a grilled cheese with bacon and peppers and it was awesome! I think it was about $12 which is reasonable.
They also have games out for customers to play, which is always fun when drinking beer with your friends."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Koren C.,"Best dang pork chop I've ever had!
From the outside it looks a little sketchy, but this was a VERY good restaurant! A must try!!
Great beers, good happy hour, even better food!
Thanks "" the brick"""
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Senor C.,"This place was SO good. The owner is really cool and the music is always fun.
With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Rich L.,"Just wanted to thank the blonde haired girl and bearded guy working tonight for showing racism. We walked in approx 30 mins ago and sat down at the table next to the bar. No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Andrea I.,"We found this gem on Yelp, and another fantastic find it was. It has local beer on tap that my husband really liked and I had a ""Fru-Fru"" drink the Lavender Mule which was amazing. As if the great drinks weren't enough the food was just as amazing. Ordered the Pastrami Melt and it was some of the best tasting pastrami I have had.
The waitress was very informative and helpful, she knew her products and had answers to all our our questions.
This place is quite a find and it is worth the visit."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Ran L.,"True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Jean K.,"We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Ahmed F.,"Such a great spot!
The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.
I had a chat with the staff present and they were really friendly and engaging in conversation.
Can't wait to be back for more!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Heather W.,"Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Maddy L.,"Yay I am a fan! The Mean Sandwich is right next to a brewery, so you can take your food and go over there! The time we waited took a while, but the food is fair priced and very good. I got the italian sandwich and my friend got the med - both very delicious. The potatoes are also very good (highly rec the buffalo ones!!)"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Morgan J.,"The buon appetito sandwich, which is a fried chicken sandwich, was lackluster IMO. There wasn't much flavor and there was way too much bread and not enough chicken. I asked for a side of pickles to jazz it up. The menu is heavy on meats, slaws, pickled stuff, and buffalo sauce, which is not my personal fave but many others will love.
On the bright side, this place is dog friendly with a huge patio out back including ping pong and cornhole! It would be a great place to go with a group of friends. We went at a weird time, like 4 pm on a Thursday, and there was no one else there!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Samer K.,The grub hub driver lied about picking up my order but I thought it was super thoughtful for the Mean Sandwich staff to contact me and let me know about this issue because I didn't know and just thought food was on the way. Great customer service
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Vijay S.,"Had a mean sandwich (corned beef, cabbage, mustard, mint and maple syrup) with falafel added - was such a great sandwich. They source their meats locally, make their own falafel (really good) and are just the type of place you would want to go to after a few brews (or even pick up a sandwich at lunch)
Highly recommend."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Alyssa M.,"Love this place. Went for the first time today with my dog and the owner came out to the patio to say hi, give my dog (Scout) some love, and thank us for coming in. Really friendly guy, it's always nice to know the people behind a local businesses.
I had the falafel sandwich and it was bomb. The pickles on it had a great tang to balance out the falafel. It was definitely Scout-Approved and we will be back!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Maggie R.,"Oyster po'boy was amazing. I had it with a pilsner, which enhanced the experience. My family and I came here after visiting the Nordic Museum, and I'm glad we did. Initially we were going to go to the brewery next door after ordering sandwiches, but they were closed that day. Turns out that was OK, because we still got good beer with our sandwiches. The po'boy was slightly spicy, which I thought was delicious. It was a generous size, so I left feeling satisfied and refreshed. The space isn't exactly what I'd call ""comfortable,"" but that's OK because I was focused on the FOOD. Plus, they had puppy videos playing on the large TV in the corner. Who knew there was a channel dedicated to adorable pets? I couldn't help but smile and laugh."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Sheri C.,"Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.
Food: 5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4
Parking: 3 - It's freaking Ballard"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Brendan c.,"I would definitely go back but ratios of sandwiches can be off at times. The guys working there are super nice and the place is spotless. If your lucky to be there when it's open, get a sandwich and if you aren't hungry, get one for later.
Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Scott X.,"I have now tried several of the sandwiches...All are delicious but only 3 stars because SMALL...The fillings ie....Chicken Cutlets, Sardines etc...are, no other way to describe it, SKIMPY...I'm from NY where sandwiches at this price point are HUGE and having come here off and on for work for quite a while I can cut them some slack (the food worlds of Ballard and Brooklyn are so far apart as to almost be another country, possibly another planet :-) )...nonetheless for $15 including tax and tip it would be nice to be at the very least full...They are tasty tho'!!!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Tom C.,"So this review is going to go beyond the incredible sandwiches and touch on the awesome customer experience at Mean Sandwich. We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting. I know this all seems minor compared to the food but in today's hipster Seattle food scene I think it's rare to find a spot that not only has great food but also great people that appreciate their customers. Go for the awesome sandwiches, return for the great people!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Tori Z.,"Very unique signature sandwich. The meat is juicy and delicious and the sandwich is filled with many strong flavored ingredients - and it works. When I saw maple syrup and mint on the menu I thought it was weird, but it really balances the sandwich well. Overall a great sandwich, I'd love to come back to try other sandwiches, the skins and ins, and play corn hole and ping pong in their courtyard."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Martyn L.,"Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Amanda E.,Amazing sandwiches and staff. Ingredients are fresh and prepared to perfection. Much more than an ordinary sandwich . I'll be back!
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,J B.,"Are you in the mood for a really exceptional sandwich experience? Then I highly recommend Mean Sandwich and do get The Mean and an order of fries. The burger is really good. I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu and I'm thinking they'll be pretty good. Staff is very friendly (parking can be a bit tough, but there is street parking)."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,David B.,"Nice staff. Cool location.
I think we were oversold on the sandwiches. The hype hurt.
These were solid sandwiches.
The Mean, JCVH and Italian were ok. Nothing stellar. Ironically our veg in the group really loved the falafel sandwich. I agreed and felt a little cheated with my choice of the Italian and the too vinegary sauce and almost Jersey Mike's level of presentation.
I had and have high hopes that some adjustments will help this place live up to the hype like Dingfelders was finally able to do after some adjustments."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Dominique S.,Such a good Mean Sandwich! I love corned beef and having the MINT was so weird but complimented the other flavors so well!!!! Huge success. The owner and his brother were so welcoming. And the POTATO crisps!!!! Wow so good! Best part was the funny cat videos playing on the Tv inside. Just kidding the best part was the Jaw dropping bread pudding. Such a cool place and felt so welcoming.
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Karrissa D.,"I called this evening to verify their cacio e pepe is vegetarian, and it is! yay!
I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.
Only downside was the temperature, but that's a given with delivery. Definitely looking forward to being able to visit once everything is back open, as this was my first time trying their food. I'm for sure going to order some fresh pasta for home in the future too."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Andrea O.,"Even in these challenging times (covid-19 lockdown) these guys are rocking it. They reconfigured the restaurant for to go/delivery only orders. Got my usual favorites to go and everything was amazing. Will keep supporting them during this difficult moment, consider doing the same!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Becca H.,"Due' Cucina is a great spot for lunch or dinner! The prices are great, the servers and atmosphere are relaxed and welcoming, and the food is amazing. My go-to order is the Traditional Bolognese Ragu with traditional spaghetti. My boyfriend orders the Aglio & Olio with healthy campanelle and adds fried tofu. Be sure to get tiramisu, sharing is an option size-wise, but you won't want to. It's to die for! We placed an order for pick-up today since the city is still under the stay-at-home order. There was no fuss and no wait to get our food. We're going to continue supporting Dué through the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Yum!!!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen H.,"Thank goodness this place delivers all the way to Kirkland! I miss eating out in Seattle so I was super thankful and appreciative that we were in the delivery area.
I ordered the kale pesto campanelle and it was amazing!! I would definitely order this again. It was cooked perfectly - nice and chewy. My partner ordered the eggplant parm and he was a little disappointed with the portion size; it came in a tiny little box. He was jealous of my kale pesto pasta which I hesitantly shared with him. We shared the tiramisu at the end of our meal and it was fantastic, one of the best tiramisu I have had in awhile. Definitely planning on ordering here more while this pandemic is going on. Highly recommend!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Richard U.,"3.5 star place!
Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Holly L.,"The pasta was very tasty! Excellent. If I had eaten on-site, I'd probably rate higher. I love that you can really taste the truffle oil in the mushroom pasta dish. The pomodoro was simple but hit the spot.
However, I ordered delivery through Yelp/Grub Hub and it was an awful wait. On yelp, it said 30-50 min wait time. However I waited 1.5 hours or 40 mins to 1 hour more wait time than I expected. I was tired and hadn't eaten for more than 9 hours so I picked the place that could be the least amount of wait. The restaurant blamed the grub hub driver, and when I called grub hub they weren't taking calls. After my 3rd call to grub hub, they also blamed the driver and gave me a lousy 10% discount for my next purchase.
I'd probably eat here again but NEVER use delivery."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Marie B.,"I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Theresa L.,Ordered from here for the first time last night. Had delivered and dropped at the front door. Everything was timely manor and tasted great! Can't wait to try more
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Julia L.,"Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Pauli D.,"Fresh pasta + mushroom sauce =
----
Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!
----
My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Edward A.,"Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Yvonne Yiyao X.,"Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Cristina G.,"I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Brianna F.,"We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Derek H.,"AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Monica L.,"I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Tracy C.,This was one of the most highly rated restaurants in Capitol Hill so I had very high expectations but I was disappointed. I got the traditional bolognese and I was expecting it to have lots of sauce and flavour but the toppings tasted off and it was too dry. My pasta also took a long time to prepare compared to my friends so I thought it would be super fresh but it wasn't at all. I recommend skipping this restaurant if you're looking for Italian food.
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen L.,"My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Melody Y.,"Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,chara c.,"Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sarah M.,"Yummy, with big portions. Had takeout during the Covid epidemic, and during this time they are offering 20% off to go orders -- even for wine. I can only imagine how it would be even better for a sit down visit and can't wait for the chance to go back during better times."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Dan T.,"We ordered takeout yesterday due to the quarantine of the city. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food we have ever had and so welcome during these challenging times. Chef Antolin is the best at his craft.
We will definitely be calling in another order soon. For everyone who wants a truly first class meal please support this restaurant and their staff.
Thank you for making our dinner and evening so enjoyable at home."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Mike V.,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,David P.,"Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Chris A.,"A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Thao N.,"First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Nicole A.,"I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Janhavi B.,"Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jordan N.,"I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacqueline H.,"Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Heidi L.,"I was looking for a nice date night spot for my boyfriend and I since we were craving Italian food for our anniversary. The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time we came in. The chef, himself stopped by our table asking how our food was, he then recommended a spicy oil that would go well with my special pasta. I love spicy food so that was a pleasant experience and it complimented the food well. Both the pasta dishes were filled with flavor and just danced in our taste pallet. It had us talking about it for the rest of the evening haha. I would definitely comeback for another date night!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Lynden L.,"My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jun Li Z.,"Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Amanda I.,"I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sloan C.,"Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Annalise W.,"Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Alex O.,"Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Artemis L.,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacey H.,"Yes, yes, yes. Great service, cozy little atmosphere. Not pretentious. Everything was perfect."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Michael G.,"Excellent all around.
We came on a Friday night. Many open tables, but they were committed to upcoming diners, so we were seated at the bar. Our good luck since we got to chat up many people behind the bar.
Interesting menu choices, tapas, full dishes, that start traditional Italian but also have a Spanish twist to many items.
We had veal marsala and vodka penne. The marsala was particularly adventurous. Great wine by the glass choices.
Tiramisu is a have-to-have. Eastlake should be proud to have this in their neighborhood!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,John W.,"What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Ken H.,"I love the food. Second to none
The customer service is terrible
Been along time customer and the service has plumbed. They used to be warm and welcoming but not anymore
The owner is wonderful and I wish her the best but the the staff is uninviting, rude and cold.
If you go here it's for the food only."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Zachariah H.,"I've been to Machiavelli 3 or 4 times now but my opinion of it goes down each time. While the food + price is 5 stars, the wait time & experience makes me feel miserable. Here's my most recent (Tuesday night!) experience:
I arrive and meet two of my friends who are sitting on a bench in the entry hall. Our 4th friend is running late so we can't put our name down yet. This entry hall is maybe 4 feet wide with a small bench & people streaming in and out past the small horde of people waiting. Claustrophobic. After 10 minutes or so, some seats open up in the slightly less crowded bar area. We sit and it's bearable but not like we actually get anything to drink since a) no one comes by to take such an order & b) we're here to eat Italian food not drink shitty alcohol. The clincher is that after our 4th arrives, I have to jostle for position with the other prospective diners as we flag down a harried receptionist who exasperatedly writes our names on the wait list. After 20 minutes, we're finally ready to begin waiting for a table.
Many other restaurants in Capitol Hill also have bad wait times but they usually also:
- Take a phone number & call/text when the table is ready.
Or
- Let you put your name down before your whole party is there."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Prag R.,"Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Khanh N.,"I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nancy W.,"I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Danielle D.,"TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Janhavi B.,"My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Isaiah G.,A friend referred me here. We we're in Seattle and our hotel was only two blocks away. We decided to come here for valentines. I can't really judge the wait based on going on the busiest holiday in the year. The is a small but really cute restaurant. As soon as you walk in there's a bench you can sit at if you need to wait. There's a good size bar with tables to the right. Up two steps is the hostess. Once you go to what is considered the second floor it's a small restaurant. I almost felt like I was in a home. The bread and oil they gave with the bread was really good. I ordered a Cesar salad that was pretty good too. My husband ordered your typical spaghetti and meat balls. To my surprise it was pretty authentic and very delicious. I ordered pasta with a white sauce and prawns. My dish was just as good if not better. The service was very good and professional. I would definitely be returning.
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenny C.,"It has been a long time since I've been here and on a Friday night there was about a 45 minute wait. The good thing about their waitlist is, if you miss your spot they'll put you in line for the next table so it is not like you have to wait all over again.
I don't really enjoy the atmosphere of this place and that's the main reason for me not coming back. It's crowded and loud and not in the least bit romantic if you're looking to come here for a date. That being said, I did enjoy the food. The Caesar salad had a good dressing and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I loved my linguine vongole and that was definitely the better of the two pasta dishes but I think I would be smart and just get takeout next time.
There is a 5% cash discount so bring some cash if you would like to save a little money."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Dione L.,"Me and my boyfriend always walk by this restaurant and have been dying to go. We finally made it over here and literally probably MY FAVORITE italian spot in seattle.
The staff/ service was fantastic. The restaurant was super cozy and fun. The food is super reasonable and portions were good.
The pasta was super fresh i got the spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. Super light and good flavors. I'm going to have dreams about this pasta no joke!
10/10 come"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Carol B.,"Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Victoria H.,"Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nita L.,"TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Michael G.,"Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenn N.,"We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Tom B.,"I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata
fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Elizabeth K.,"I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Sou M.,"My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Pinky P.,"This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Phil G.,"A week ago, we were told Tavolata wouldn't do take out. I phoned tonight, 3/13/2020, and sure enough, Tavolàta was happy to have us pick up food. We have been on a social distance quarantine since the Coronavirus pandemic erupted. I guess other people aren't reading the same research I am. People were out and about, in spite of the rain, and in spite of any contagious virus. The bars on 2nd Avenue were full, including the bar at Tavolàta. I felt foolish, locking myself inside all week, but then again, my age is susceptible to complications if I contract the Coronavirus. Foolish, paranoid, overly cautious, vigilant, better safe than sorry; who knows?
The food from Tavolàta was good. Our rigatoni and pappardelle pastas were good. The Arancini balls were a bit bland for my taste. Carpaccio was okay. Bread was well baked. Prices were Seattle high - $100 for this meal. Expensive, but there isn't much choice in the Emerald City. This is not an egalitarian city anymore."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Brian B.,"Great service! Great food! Definitely Italy recommend the knoche! My wife and I will definitely be back!
Update: we came back and it was amazing again! Seriously love this place!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Maia R.,"Terribly disappointing experience, and had it not been for our waitress, this would be one star. I had made our reservations the day Valentine's Day reservations opened and the menu posted at Tavolata. Despite our early booking, we were seated in the very center of a communal table (that, as I recall, I had specifically requested to avoid). The table was too loud for me and my boyfriend to even speak to each other, so we requested to be moved to another table. Meanwhile there were several other couples at their own tables, including one couple at a 4-top. They sat us at the bar, which was fine.
Once we were seated at the bar, we reviewed the menu. The menu in our hands had almost entirely different courses for the pasta and entree from what Tavolata had posted online and the menu we had so been looking forward to. This was incredibly disappointing and deceptive in my opinion.
Our waitress at the bar was lovely (blonde curly hair and tall). But the servers left dirty plates on our spot for too long (I had to ask them to clear the appetizer plates) and they did not seem appropriately trained. I overheard one server saying it was his third day at the job, and the hosts (we were sitting directly next to them) were cursing and mocking some of the patrons to each other by the end of our dinner.
Also, our ticket for our 2nd and 3rd courses ""got lost."" We waited over 1.5 hours for our pasta course after getting the appetizers. When our waitress told us this, she was apologetic but didn't offer any recourse until I asked her if we could have more wine since we had drank the glass that was supposed to be paired with our course. She was happy to oblige but it was pretty clear all we would have gotten was an apology otherwise. When we finally got our pasta, it was cold.
The food was okay. Porchetta was way too salty with huge salt crystals and peppercorns intact that made a difficult texture to chew. If they had had their promised menu I would have ordered the lobster (by the way, Tavolata, don't promise this as a menu item if you aren't positive you'll get it. We had thought about going to the lobster dinner at Derby but didn't because we saw we would get lobster on this menu. What a waste.) Mushroom ravioli was okay but not what I was looking forward to going into the meal. Port wine pairing was cheap and too sweet. 2.5 hours later we left our meal feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.
I've had quite a few experiences with Tavolata before this, but after being so disappointed with this deceptive and uncomfortable experience, I will never be returning."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Zachary H.,"My gf and I went here for our anniversary.
We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Kamara S.,"Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Heather W.,"Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Michelle A.,Happy hour at Tavolàta is great ! Be warned... you'll need to be first in line with your whole party in order to be seated. The pasta is pretty good. What puts the cherry on top is the fact that the pasta is made from scratch !! How many places can say that ?? Their happy hour brings plates half off and house wines as well. Employees are very friendly and check in on you often to see if you're doing okay. The reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't much seating space around the bar area... which I believe are the only seats available for Happy Hour menu options (could be mistaken). Overall I've come here a couple of times and will continue to do so.
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,David H.,"I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Madison S.,"This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Naveed N.,"Yet another Ethan Stowell homerun!
We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Tara D.,"Food was phenomenal! The duck was amazing, especially the finishing sear. The risotto was creamy and flavorf. Even the starters were great! We ordered the brussel sprouts and squash as well as the bread, and oil and vinegar. Beautiful flavors in everything! I would be happy to come back."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Rebecca W.,"This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Elly L.,"We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Joel Y.,"Deeeelicious! Came here on a Saturday night and even though it was busy, was able to find seating almost right away. The service was great, ambience was superb, and the food was yum.
Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Emily H.,"Outstanding pasta! A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Marina K.,Omg the potato gnocchi is the best! Cocktails and service is lovely as well. Great place for family or friend dinner and maybe a first date. We came on a week day around 6pm and got a table no problem but call ahead to make sure they have room. Nice kinda dark ambiance as well. I will def be back!
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sarah N.,"We stopped in for late night food after our flight landed and we are so Glad we came here. We were hungry, tired, and just need a good meal.
This is true homemade Italian! The ambiance and wait staff and accommodating and amazing. They help with suggestions and are prompt to check on you. The food is so fresh, homemade, and delicious. So many flavors go into each dish that make every bite appreciated.
Wine and beer selection is great - cocktails available too. Would recommend or go back if we have the chance!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Ellen C.,"I forgot how good this place is, having gone to the Cap Hill location. My friends and I stopped by for dinner Friday night at around 8pm and got seated quickly without reservations. I ordered the rigatoni and let me say that the pasta was cooked to perfection. I ate that entire dish as if I've never had pasta in my life.
Highly recommend if you've never tried this restaurant."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Julia P.,"LOVE the happy hour menu!! Super affordable and tasty dishes. My personal favorite is the pappardelle, but everything is also delicious. The bread was fresh and warm and the spices and flavors they use in their pastas really come through. I'm no expert in Italian food but and I can tell this is GOOD Italian food :)
If you decide to come here, definitely try go for the happy hour. The bar does fill up quickly so try to come early. Best to come with 2 people."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sachi E.,"fun fact: they light every single candle every day!! The ambiance of the restaurant was typical for an Italian restaurant. their food was delicious, my opinion a little over priced - still good tho. Their dessert was my favorite part! Highly recommend their creme brulee :)"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,E. R.,"I am in Seattle to help at UWMC as a Respiratory Therapist. I have been really delighted by my experience here over the last few weeks, which has been made even better with places like this. I ordered a Caesar salad and gnocchi to take with me on my overnight shift. When I stopped to pick up my order (wearing scrubs since I was on my way to work), I was handed my food and my ticket was ripped up. I was really overwhelmed! I have been trying to help local businesses by ordering out as much as possible, but to be recognized for helping during the pandemic is appreciated immensely. The best part? The food was wonderful! Thank you so much, Bizzarro! I will be back and my tip will reflect my gratitude."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Sabryna M.,"A hard five stars for this quirky and authentic Italian restaurant! The first and most notable feature is their magnificent decoration! Bikes hang from the ceiling, ""Big eyes"" paintings with a Wes Anderson narrator on a old time stereo greet you in the bathroom, with many other alluring Knick knacks in every corner.
Not only is the ambiance to die for, BUT THE FOOD! Hand rolled pastas with many other on season dishes for a super reasonable price. They have a famous tomato based sauce that is a must taste (My fave thing on their menu is the ""Margarita"" pasta dish)
Y'all, if you live in/ visit Seattle you literally have to go to this place. If you didn't, that'd be super BIZARRE of you"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Michelle L.,"Oh mine!!!
The place just threw me off completely!
Very small tiny restaurant with corky cute interesting decor.
We got here early around 5:30pm and it was almost full, we took the last 2 seater on the place.
As always, my husband came super prepared, read all the Yelpies' reviews, so he knows what he wants. On the other hand, I just walked in with no clue, so every pasta dish seems yummm.
Our server recommended me to try the Forest Floor Frenzy which is a wild mushroom & walnut parpadelle with cream sherry sauce. This is the most amazing pasta dish I ever have, not exaggerating!! The cream sherry sauce was in a perfect rich creamy consistency coating the think smooth parpadelle. The wild mushrooms had hint of woodiness that might be the sherry sauce amplified must better, and along with the slight crunch of chopped walnuts. I was mmm-ing through every bite.
Then I swapped with my husband's order, the Elk Bolognese. He didn't seem to be too excited about it, but when he passed me his dish, and I took a swift, the aroma captivated me already. The rich sweet peppery smell was making me drool! The elk was pretty lean and not gamey, so blended right in with the pork shoulder. The parpadelle was just the right chew and thinness, amazing!!
I tried the dessert of the day, chevre cheesecake with rosemary graham crust & vanilla olive oil roasted grapes & a black vanilla tea honey sauce. Yeah, you heard me, chevre cheesecake!! It was definitely heavenly! I never had a goat cheesecake before, and I have to say, I'm never a big fan of goat cheese, but I just cannot stop nodding my head and squinting my chinese eyes and giggle! This cheesecake was so delicious!! The goat cheese was on the mild side with some lemon zest or lemon juice blended in that popped in my mouth. I was super happy with the vanilla live oil roasted grapes, taste exactly what it sound, amazingly delicious! It's rare to see olive oil used in dessert so I was very intrigued. Lastly, the black vanilla tea honey sauce had some depth from the tea aroma which blended the cheesecake and rosemary graham crust very well. BEST GOAT CHEESECAKE ever! Even though it was my first
When we left shortly after 6pm, there were at least 3-4 parties waiting outside the restaurant, so do try to come early! Free street parking in the neighborhood, just to make sure not to block someone's driveway
I am still super stoked and savoring all the tastes from this amazing dinner! Already thinking when I can come back!!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Erin M.,"We're headed back tonight so I guess I should get around to reviewing our last experience!
We arrived around 8 on a Weeknight and I had had a terrible day, it was pouring, we were freezing and tired, and Italian was calling our name.
Welcomed at the front door, they led us back to the ""Best Table in the House"" - a tiny, candlelit table tucked into a little alcove in the back of the restaurant, where the glass table top covers hundreds of little notes left on the back of dinner receipts from others who have sat here.
We always start with Arancini - these are creamy and just the right bit of a bite, crispy and nestled in a little bath of Bizzaro's delicious marinara.
I order the Meatballs, available only on Monday nights. He orders the special - Gnocchi with Italian sausage.
The server is the same woman who has waited on us our last 5 times here - I wish I knew her name so I could give her the recognition she deserves. She's funny, so friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. We love her!
Food arrives - gnocchi is pillowy and rich, slightly chewy, drenched in a delicious, creamy, herb filled cream sauce. The meatballs are tucked into a perfectly cooked pile of pasta - not spaghetti, but a shorter, thicker, rolled tube noodle covered in light and garlicky marinara, and swaddled in a blanket of melted cheese.
We are far enough away from other tables that we
can enjoy the bits of their conversation that we hear, but we are private enough to enjoy our own.
For dessert, we had gelato that came with some pretty cute little friends on top - that I didn't even mind beheading to scoop up a bit of melted gelato.
Bottom line - we didn't need romance but it's impossible not to get swept up in it if you're here with someone you love. We didn't need for anything while we were there because the service is excellent. And we didn't need two boxes for leftovers because the boyfriend ate his whole plate clean.
Please go here. Please keep this place alive. Bizzaros is a gem that should be shined!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Marissa K.,"Even in this crazy time, the amazing humans at Bizzarro went above and beyond to make a birthday special. And, of course, the food was incredible. Every experience with Bizzarro is better than the last. Thank you!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Jessica M.,"The food didn't match the hype for us, but the service was exceptional.
3 stars for the food and 5 for the service so we'll leave it a 4 overall.
Came here on a Monday night just before the prime dinner rush, and thankfully we did. This place was fulllll. Even with two large parties, our server gave us plenty of attention and was so sweet. This restaurant has parking right in front, although only a handful of spots, and has the quirkiest decor.
We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.
The pasta itself was just ok - I really wished I had liked it more given all the raving reviews. I'm tempted to come back here to try some of the other pasta dishes though."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Patrick C.,"This is the cutest cafe with lots of little bits and baubles everywhere. The place is always busy and usually requires a wait. After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope. I think for the money Zouave over on 65th is much, and less insanely crowded."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Safina H.,Ordered twice now via caviar. SO TASTY! I'm sad I haven't yet visited the restaurant.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Linda L.,"Came here for dinner and the experience absolutely blew my mind. The environment is quirky and unique, and the service is excellent. The food though - - WOW. We had the arancini to start. The sauce around the arancini was some of the best that I have ever tasted. We also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi with Italian sausage, as well as the wild mushroom parapadelle. Both were very rich, with superb flavor. I can't wait to go back to try the wild elk bolognese, which is their most popular dish. They serve wine casual Italian style, out of rocks glasses.
If you come after 5:30 you can expect a wait. Definitely will be a wait if you come after 6"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Regina X.,"Snap pea carbonara had the right flavors with the heavy cheesiness cut by the crispy snap peas and pancetta. The linguini, however, was overcooked and a sad lump hard to separate. For appetizer, the Arancini rice balls were heavy and cheesy but made for a nicely textured dish. Love the outlandish decor and would be back for more pasta."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Alex O.,"I don't like it. The bread was just not tasty and it felt old & stale. I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Brittini C.,"So we ordered take out from here this weekend and was a little disappointed. 1) Their ""small salad "" for 10 bucks is nothing more than about three pieces of lettuce and one strip of carrot - definitely NOT worth it. 2) They completely forgot adding the chicken on one of our pastas which was an extra charge 3) They packaged the other pasta horribly and the sauce spilled completely in the bag. What was left was thin and insubstantial- for a 20 dollar pasta dish I expected ALOT more. 4) I will say, their chicken dish was AMAZING. Almost worth overlooking their shortcomings. Almost. Unfortunately there is far too many good restaurants bringing their A game to consider being a repeat customer."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,SonyA C.,"This is my favorite Italian place in Seattle. It has a cozy and interesting ambiance and the food is phenomenal. I especially love the bread and the seasonal dishes. Each entree comes with a fresh salad, with optional upgrade to Caesar salad, spinach salad, or soup. I honestly liked the starter salad the best.
All our dishes felt very high quality. They were well made and their ingredients seemed especially good. My favorite dish was the forest floor frenzy and it's assortment of mushrooms. So tasty.
In conclusion, this would be a great place for a date night. Tasty food, cozy ambiance, unusual decor, and not too loud to have conversation. Watch out though, it's popular and if you go at prime dinner time, you'll need to wait."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Jessica T.,"My family and I were on vacation in Seattle and stopped here for dinner. We all loved the look and feel of the place. Atmosphere is definitely bizzarro.
There was no wait time for a table of 4/weeknight.
Starter salad had a mild, sweet dressing that even our pickiest teenager enjoyed.
Food was really good. Forest Floor Frenzy was creamy and mushroomy heaven.
Lasagna- good
Meatballs-great
Antipasta plate-great
What else about this place? The bathrooms. Weird recording playing in one of them with paintings of big eyed children. Creepy and intriguing."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Ra L.,"Amazing house made gluten free pasta, spectacular food all around especially their seasonal dishes, the staff is absolutely amazing, good wine"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Mahsa S.,the restaurant has a great atmosphere with eclectic decor. It's fairly small so expect a long wait. The food was good but a bit expensive for just simple marinara pasta and cheese. The complimentary bread was delicious though
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Nishita K.,Highly recommend the tiramisu! Best I have had in a long time. Aranciji was okay. The pastas were delicious. The proportions were great. I had the seasonal pasta 'bombastica'. It was white wine based not too acidic. Very light and flavorful. The elk pasta was hearty and very flavoful. I thought I wouldn't like it because it's elk meat but I would definitely get it for myself next time. Forest floor frenzy as well as the chicken main course we're delicious. Service was great! The servers were very cheerful and gave some nice recommendations and answered our questions. They served us some bread while we waited for our food. We waited for about 30/35 mins on a Friday night to get a table for 4.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Tayler H.,"Bizzaros is a kooky and perfect little Italian hole-in-the-wall! I 10/10 recommend eating here. It's easy to access right off the I-5 freeway, and is in a very cute and ""old"" restaurant row.
The restaurant itself is very homey, with ""bizzare"" decor. Loved the romantic/fun lighting. Our waitress was very nice.
The food itself was fresh and different than what I've had before. We really enjoyed our dinner here!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Ray M.,"This spot is a must for locals and visitors. It is quintessential Seattle in all the right ways.
I love this spot because it is as fun as it is tasty. And it is very fun... and very tasty. So much eye candy and everything on the menu is ridiculously good.
If you haven't been to Bizzarro, then I recommend you go. And if you are planning to go to Bizzarro, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the lasagna - you're welcome :) Enjoy"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Nita L.,"Most aptly named, this place is a Bizarre combination of Romantic yet Eclectic.
Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!
I've read other reviews complaining about the wait time, but I went on a Tuesday evening so I did not face this issue. Definitely a fantasic choice for your dose of Italian, Romance and crazy! Ill be back for sure."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Juanita K.,"I love this restaurant!!! My daughter who just moved to Seattle in March took us to this restaurant just before the lock down and the food was great, the prices were so affordable and I loved the ambiance. I told my daughter to make sure she orders food from them every week with the hopes that they stay in business because I can't wait to go back there. I plan to eat there every night trying some new every time!!!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Piko L.,"""I'm so full but I must keep eating"" is the motto you leave with after dining here!
Everything here is delicious-- from their bruschetta to their seafood pastas, their pizzas and calzones, nothing disappoints. It's ALL good!
The place is great for dates or groups, and the cute orange walls really set the mood.
I can't wait to come back in the daytime for outside seating so I can get a good photo of this delicious pasta!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Valerie S.,"Delicious Italian food!
We ordered takeout since we wanted to eat at the comfort of our own place that was just beside the restaurant as I read that service could be better. I looooooove carbonara pasta and was stoked to see it on the menu w their homemade spaghetti. It had just the right touch of cream, bacon, and cheese. Mmm! Although I was eyeing the pesto penne, we went with the spaghetti de mare because my mom wanted something w seafood. That was light and scrumptious as well. If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet. It was the icing on top of an already totally above our expectations meal. If you're in the area, stop by for some homemade pasta. Your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Judy M.,"Tbh we were supposed to trot over to the Pink Door on this night, but we were just too tired to haul everyone back to that area. Yelpers guided us to this spot. We were only a hop and a skip away from this great neighborhood Italian Restaurant! Amongst the dishes we had ordered were the Frutti di mare (seafood pasta), Bolognese, and carbonara. The seafood was cooked perfectly, not overcooked (say no to rubbery seafood!), bolognese had lots of flavor, and carbonara was good. Overall it was satisfying. Our service was excellent, really helped the experience overall.
Although this wouldn't be a designation restaurant, I would still recommend it if you are nearby, and got a hankering for Italian food."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Nancy S.,"The food and service here is just amazing!!! Came here with a friend on the recommendation of another good friend and I have no regrets!
I ordered their seafood spaghetti and was not disappointed- it had sooooooooooo much delish seafood on it!!! The portioning is very generous and the quality exceptional... can't wait to come here again!!!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Lana P.,"Super disappointing. Deserving good reviews brought us here for dinner.
Service sucks and don't mind little fruit flies all over your food. Food was very so so and I could not get out there fast enough to get away from those flies and dirty walls."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Rpisces G.,"First time at this local restaurant, food and service were both really good, will definitely be back. Had the lasagna which was very meaty, delicious."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Abhinav S.,"Had a crave for Italian food, and wanted to try out a new place. So this brought me to La Vita.
Ambiance:
It has a nice dim-lit casual atmosphere. Lunch and dinner is good here.
Service:
Service is alright. They don't do anything out of their way, or even try to be friendly. You're just a paying customer to them, that's about it.
Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.
All in all, if you're willing to forgive their dismal excuse of a bread and look past that, everything else is great!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,D C.,"This is our favorite local Italian place. They have a great menu and we love their specials. The prices are very reasonable, especially for Seattle. We come here so often that many of the staff know who we are and will drop by our table to say hello. We brought our relatives from Italy here for dinner one night and they loved it. The owner,Giuseppe made them feel at home speaking in Italian and bringing all of our dishes family style. Perfect ending to their American vacation :-)"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Francesco L.,I've been coming here for about a year and a half now and this place never disappoints. Great hours and great food. If your looking for some great Italian food in Downtown Seattle this place is a must
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Fraser C.,"I have been dining here a few times a year for over 10 years. The food is AMAZING and the service is great. Some of the best pasta in town!
The quality of food is very high and prices are reasonable."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Sharon C.,"Came here to celebrate my friends' birthdays! There's plenty of street parking. Pretty good prices for pasta here. It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Stephanie L.,"I had the cannelloni. You read that correctly- that is not cannoli! Think enchiladas but Italian! The big noodles were smothered in bolognese and cheese. Every bite was heaven. The portion is great if you're really hungry. Otherwise lucky you, leftovers for lunch! This is one of the most amazing Italian dishes I've ever had. The atmosphere here is lively as well. I can't wait to go back. I'll try to get something different but something tells me I'll be getting the cannelloni again :)."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Kayla K.,"I'll start off by saying that the food was good.
However, everything else was not good. I asked the server his preference between two pasta dishes. He suggested one over the other, so I ordered that. Our salad came out quickly, and then the entrees took forever. We were all very hungry by the time our entrees arrived, about 30+ minutes later. The entree given to me was not what I had ordered. It wasn't even the other pasta dish I had asked about. I told the waiter this and he begrudgingly took the entree away. It was not what I had ordered, why is that my fault? I thought that they would hurry to make the correct entree, but I was wrong. My family finished their meals and then my food was given to me. At this point, I had waited an hour total for my entree. I asked the server for pepper flakes, he never came back with them. I had to ask two more times before they were brought to me.
Then, the receipt came. We were charged for the incorrect entree that they had initially brought out to me. The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to fix the receipt. They not only tried to charge us more than we should have paid, but did not apologize once, or comp anything for the inconvenience. Not even my $3 soft drink.
A sorry would have gone a long way in this situation, but it never came. The whole time I felt like I was the one at fault. We will not be returning to La Vita E Bella."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Joan S.,"I went on an excursion today with my dog and walk down second Avenue just to see what was down there and I went to this restaurant the food was amazing they allowed me to bring my dog in and sit at a table I had the biggest Caesar salad I've ever had in my whole life and the lasagna was enough for two people extremely fresh and they gave me garlic bread and a whole meal was $24. Really?
The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,
You might also meet Giuseppe Forte the owner
Another fantastic meal at the restaurant today
Pasta dish with chicken sausage
Service amazing
Great experience
Lunch time today on a nice day !!!
All staff generally friendly go have lunch!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Maddie E.,"We discovered this place on Postmates and keep coming back for more. If you're looking for pasta, the carbonara is a MUST get. It's incredible. Their bread and salads are mediocre but I strictly come here for carbonara."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Douglas W.,"Amazing service. They weren't super busy but seemed to be under staffed. Our waiter was juggling multiple tables but knew how to handle it. When he felt he wasn't visiting us fast or often enough he'd do a drive by and update us on where we stood. That small gesture makes the difference. My wife and I just took the time to have a great conversation about our vacation in Seattle.
Once the food arrive it was nothing short of AMAZING!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Crystal F.,"We ordered takeout through GrubHub from this restaurant. The carbonara we received was clearly mad with whole eggs--there were chunks of gross undercooked egg whites throughout. We immediately contacted GrubHub who contacted the restaurant. The restaurant's response was ""we cannot guarantee the quality of the food"" and they refused to refund us for the inedible dish. Food wasn't good and customer service was worse."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,JC J.,"Service was great
Food was very tasty
Ambiance: terrible, my eyes are really bad, and the place is just too damn dark, I cant read the menu. Had to open my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. The pizza was good, but the sausage could have been more.. it was just sprinkled with a few shredded sausages... was just in the center of the pie.
Overall was good. I'd come again, but next time I will try to request to sit outside patio. 3 stars for now, I'll change my rating next time I come back."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Edward S.,"La Vita E Bella is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Belltown. It has a really old school feel to it. In English, the name translates to Life and Beautiful, which is a good name.
The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.
I will definitely be back"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Kurt A.,"We have enjoyed Brunello many times, and were saddened when the virus struck the restaurant industry. Sadness turned to gladness when we learned that Brunello was offering takeout, and it did not disappoint: lasagne, rigatoni al salsiccio, baked olives, and Caesar salad were as delicious out of the box as in their beautiful dining room. Bravo, Brunello!"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Miranda P.,"My husband and I ate our Valentine's Day dinner here, and we had a great experience!
We ordered the gnocchi with chicken and the lasagna. The gnocchi is made fresh daily in-house, and it seriously melts in your mouth! So delicious, and the chicken had a nice charbroiled flavor to it. The lasagna was also delicious--great sauce, and I loved the blend of cheeses that they used.
Best of all, the service was amazing. Both servers working at the time made our experience very special. They were attentive, friendly, and our food came out quickly. I also liked the presentation of their aranciata soda!
I would definitely recommend eating at Brunello."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Justin P.,"This review is for my experience coming here for Valentines Day. They have a set menu for $50 where you choose an appetizer, salad and entree.
7:45: Arrived at the restaurant - promptly seated and given bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
7:50: Made our choices off the menu.
8:20: Got our salad. Tasted decent but portion was pretty small.
8:50: Got our entrees. Filet mignon was really good (but you can't really mess up filet mignon right?)! Seafood linguini was lackluster. Pasta was really soft and seemed like overcooked, packaged pasta.
9:15: We were given tiramisu for our troubles.
9:45: Finally got our appetizers and a slice of lemon cake (as additional compensation) both boxed to go.
Their desserts are amazing and I want to come back on a regular day to try their food. I have no doubt in my mind that they serve great food and have kind staff.
But I felt like I was held hostage here for 2 hours - I didn't want to leave and pay $50 before I got all my (average) food. I understand that it was a busy night but they had a set menu and had a reservation system - I expected better preparation from them. People who were seated after us were getting food before us.
TLDR - 30 minutes for salad, 1 hour for entree, 2 hours for appetizer, yeesh :("
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Jenny Z.,"WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Mike N.,"Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Kristin B.,"April of this year when I went to Brunello. I had gnocchi with marinara sauce, which is one of my favorite dishes. It was delicious! I am all about sauce and this dish had it. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Paulina H.,"Food: 9/10 (Seafoods are fresh, not too spicy, everything taste perfect! But the pasta is a little salty.
Environment: 10/10 (great to sit outside when it's sunny and enjoy some wine)
Service: 10/10"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Kathryn C.,"I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Mikala K.,"My husband loved his salmon pasta with lemon butter, capers and white wine sauce $29. I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14. The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Stacy S.,"Had a weekday dinner here, based on reviews from other Yelpers. We were not disappointed.
The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Monica K.,"We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.
I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Elly S.,"I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Jasmine S.,"Cozy atmosphere and authentic Italian flavors! A bit difficult to get the staff's attention as they were super packed that night, but overall a great experience."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Clarissa L.,"We came here as it was a short drive from our Airbnb.
Delicious food! Free street parking, friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, any pasta dish can be made as a half portion for children"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Mayson L.,"I'm giving this place a 3.5/5 just by the food.
It's a small mom and pops kind of Italian restaurant which kind of makes you feel at home. The staff and waiters are super friendly and will make sure your water is never empty! Spectacular service. It was nice of them to offer all the dinner specials in a very well manner.
The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!
Overall, this is a nice date spot! They have plenty of wine options as well. Bye Seattle!"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Brice B.,"A great, affordable Italian restaurant with a cozy, authentic dining area. It's very unassuming from the outside and location. The service is great as well."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Shannon B.,"Went to Brunello on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant is beautiful! It made me feel like I was back in the Italian countryside. The service was a little slow, but too be fair, the restaurant was a little busy. I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and the Tiramisu. Both were super tasty and I would order them again."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Felisa D.,"I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back."
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Kerri K.,"It was our first time there and we will definitely return! Warm atmosphere, great food and friendly staff. Last night they had lobster spaghetti as a special dish(with saffron)--yum!"
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,Joe M.,This place is awesome! I've driven past this place for a couple of years and decided to try it. Wow glad I did. The service was top notch and the food was even better. The drinks were great and the bread was to die for. If you want a treat go here. Blown away! Great job guys!
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Michael E.,"Decided to give the new takeout menu a shot. Boy was it good. The aged steak was perfect, the pappardelle was cooked al dente along with chicken meatballs was scrumptious. The meal also came with a beet/cheese appetizer & delicious huge cookies. To top it off, we got a nice bottle of Walla Walla cab for just $15.
This is a great deal and super easy to pickup as well. Plenty of parking right out front and I received a text message that the food was ready as someone brought the food out front."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Abigail G.,Cannot ever get enough of their pasta now. I am hooked. I went in before the quarantine and enjoyed the atmosphere and the cocktails. Their menu is authentic. Tavolàta has a staff that is kind and well oiled!
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Tay W.,"Atmosphere: Dark and lively.
Service: Awesome! Our waiter gave great recommendations and checked in on us regularly.
Food: My fiancé got the rigatoni & I got the Pappardelle. Both dishes were amazing. If you like your pasta fully cooked, be sure to let your waiter know. Their pasta is cooked al dents--a bit firm. It didn't taste bad, but I wouldn't have mind if it was cooked a little bit more!"
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Natasha G.,"I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Camille W.,"My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?"
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Peter C.,"So so so much to like about Tavolata. Get the bread basket - it comes with this delicious spreadable cheese and balsamic vinegar. But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere. Anyway, just go and thank me later."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Huong L.,"This was on my list of Seattle restaurant week and it did not disappoint at all.
We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Cindy V.,"Lovely environment. Romantic for dates and a great spot for happy hour - Pasta dishes running less than $15 that are filling! My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Joey J.,"This place gets busy very, very fast. We were able to sneak into the bar area for some dinner. Cocktails were good, but the mai tai was very fruity. Espresso martinis were espresso forward.
The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.
I would go back for happy hour and just order off that menu. 4 stars without the tagliatelle factored in."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Kristen K.,"My best friend in Seattle recommended this restaurant as his favorite Italian spot in the city, so we decided to make a reservation when a group of us were in the city.
It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.
Overall, really delicious Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill. Very nice space and excellent service. Definitely would recommend coming here to try some delicious pastas!"
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Sara C.,"Really great and authentic pasta without the wait! I can't say enough great things about this place. From service to food, every experience I've had has been wonderful. The restaurant is very accommodating of big groups, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and careful with food allergies. The kitchen is on it! Food is fresh and delicious. Menu is fun and adventurous, and talk about that happy hour menu too.The atmosphere is trendy yet sophisticated.
Just go, you won't regret it, maybe make a reservation ahead of time. It's the little things, the attention to detail that add up into one great experience. I'm determined to try everything on their menu!"
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Carmen V.,"Great to remember Italian sounding restaurants you marked in your mental 'to try' list from a previous visit to Seattle. In this case, remembering the Tavolata name saved my night, as my colleague and I were literally fighting and almost grabbing each other's hair to go and have dinner together somewhere were we both could enjoy. My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.
Great quality food and very nice atmosphere. Looks like mostly customers were pretty girls in pairs (well, not talking for ourselves in this case) and some matc.com kind of couples just on a first date. Packed but fast and friendly service."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Dennis D.,"Another Ethan Stowell restaurant, this time on Capitol Hill. All about the scratch-made pasta here, and the menu has some good appetizers too.
The roasted beets were my favorite starter. The gnocchi is one of my favorite pastas on the menu- chewy and lightly bouncy texture, and the sauce tastes fresh and zesty. The pastas all are sharable too, so you'd be able to get a little bit of everything. Also, the Porchetta is great- maybe a little extra with the salt, but overall, the pork tasted good with all the accompaniments on the wood board.
It's not my personal favorite Ethan Stowell restaurant experience, but Tavolàta on Capitol Hill is an alright place to get food and drinks with friends."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Siddhartha G.,"'Woohoo as good as it gets' is just about right for Tavoláta, I don't believe I've had better Italian cuisine in recent memory. My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Ju C.,"Burrata: The cheese was just so fresh and well balanced with pear
Ricotta ravioli: The ravioli had the perfect amount of chew. The Sauce was nutty, zesty and sweet, perfect with ricotta cheese.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The handmade pasta was so good and the ragu sauce was just a little spicy and minty so not greasy at all."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Kevin Z.,"Pretty run of the mill Italian fare. We had a large table come in for a birthday dinner. We ordered the rigatoni, papparadelle, tagliatelle, spaghetti and meatballs, hanger steak, and porchetta. The pastas were ultimately forgettable as the flavors and textures were decent but nothing special. Visually, the porchetta was stunning but came to our table very cold and had to be reheated. The dish ended up being disappointing because it was fairly one dimensional favor wise.
Overall, service was great but food left much to be desired."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Katie L.,"Came in here wanting the Seattle restaurant week deal, but decided to have happy hour instead so we sat at the bar! Service was good and attentive. Upon sitting down, our server/bartender asked us if we wanted anything to drink, so we ordered a Rose and moscato. Rose was good, but moscato was too sweet for me but my friend liked it. We then ordered the salami board, bruschetta, gnocchi, and the papperdelle pasta! The appetizers came out first, with the entree coming out a bit after. Everything tasted good but the bread for the brushetta could be softer. We also ordered a cherry cider and a pudding like dessert, which both tasted great! I've been to the other Tavolàta location and honesty, this location has better service and food tasted better.
I would come back and recommend it to friends looking for a date spot or happy hour spot!"
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Eugene W.,"Superstar performance for restaurant week.
~~Appetizers~~
Bruschetta: Perfectly crisped bread paired with rich and smoky salmon. The blend of savory salmon and aioli with sour pickled onion on top of their bread was too good to resist.
Burrata: The burrata was even tastier than the bruschetta. The cheese was just so fresh and delicious. This was my first time having burrata, so I don't know how it compares.
~~Main~~
Rigatoni: Slightly spicy with very rich sausage. It was topped heartily with shaved cheese. The pasta had the perfect amount of chew, and soaked in the tomato sauce quite well.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The pappardelle was perfect. Everything from the meat to the sauce was done perfectly. A+ dish.
~~Dessert~~
Sorbetto: Mango sorbetto was too sour. This would be okay if there were more sweet things in the dish to balance it out. Alas, the shortbread cookie was too little.
Buttermilk Panna Cotta: AMAZING dessert. Super creamy and creative to use ""sweetened"" rhubarb to top it off.
Tavolata really hit a home run with the pappardelle and panna cotta. Our waiter was really nice and took time to talk to us about the dishes."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Elisabeth P.,"We checked this place out for Seattle's restaurant week and loved the vibe. The area of Seattle its in is a bit tough for parking so I spent about 40 mins looking for street parking on a Sunday during the dinner hour. I was definitely approaching hangry state after it taking that long to get parked so I was super excited to enjoy some wine and snackas.
We had reservations and were seated quickly in a nice booth overlooking the street. Loved the design of the restaurant with wood and black accents and hanging bulb industrial lighting. The restaurant week menu was extensive and had lots of options for $35. There were plenty of gluten free options for me to indulge in and diffuse my hangry state with including gf pasta!
I had the burrata with a delicious rhubarb agrodolce that was beautifully served on a wood plank with bits of bright green garnish. It was a great flavor profile and I really enjoyed the complexity of the rhubarb. Ooobviously I was forced to ruin my diet with gf pasta because..well..they had it available. I selected the orecchiette with gf penne substituted. I absolutely loved the nettle pesto and it was delicious with the mushrooms. The last course was the only option I could have and that was the panna cotta. I wasn't crazy about this one.
Our service was good but we definitely spent some time waiting scanning for our server wanting to order our second glass of wine. Overall though, we were definitely impressed with the menu and will be returning to further explore it."
Tavolàta,(206) 420-8355,Ellen C.,"This place is always consistent in terms of food and service. Came back during Seattle Restaurant Week ($35 for 3 courses). Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,J. T.,"An experience to remember!!! The food was amaaaazing! Came here for my birthday pre-pandemic, and left 3 hrs later after sampling what felt like half the menu. Simply wonderful!"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Sebastian N.,"Il Nido is a cozy little nook in West Seattle with very respectable hospitality and cuisine.
We started with the light and fluffy house-made focaccia, the surprising bit was that the olive oil they served it with was perfectly light, fruity, and grassy. It's the little details like this that tells that the kitchen really knows what they're doing.
The beet pasta with pistachio pesto was my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly cooked, fresh made pasta coated in a peppery and minty pesto. For our third course we got crispy smashed potatoes that were covered in rosemary and malt vinegar powder, it was served with a perfectly balanced horseradish sauce. Also, we ordered the steelhead trout which was perfectly cooked and served in a tomato paprika broth.
Dessert was a tiramisu with a fantastically oversized pizzelle on top, and a bright berry pavlova.
The host was warm and welcoming and took a few minutes to chat with us during our dessert and gave us some great local food tips. Our server was friendly and did a great job of explaining the menu. The decor stays true to the historical log cabin structure which is pretty much a historical artifact in modern day West Seattle.
Ten out of ten, would come again."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Derek B.,"Great ambiance walking into this place. The host was incredibly welcoming (and handsome). We sat down and the server promptly greeted us to ask about drinks (so important). He ended up being very helpful in selecting a reasonably priced bottle of wine that paired very well with our entire meal, which is not an easy task.
The burrata and prosciutto to start was next-level amazing. Wow. It seemed a bit pricey, but after experiencing it, it all made sense and was totally worth it.
As expected, the pasta was on point and excellent.
We didn't know if we should get the regular sized bistecca or the portion for 2. The regular size was the perfect amount. The steak was cooked perfectly and quality meat. It's a personal preference that I wish it would have had a more pronounced and charred crust. But nice flavors coming through nonetheless.
For everything that we got and the quality of this food experience, I am very impressed with how they keep this at such a relatively reasonable price point (just like Il Corvo, where they could obviously charge more if they wanted to). Well done. Assuming I can get another reservation, I will be coming back."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Dave C.,"So very glad this outstanding restaurant has settled into the historic Homestead Cabin just off Alki Beach.
We've had three meals now, no easy feat given the intense demand for reservations since they opened last summer. They all were among the very best we've had in Seattle. The pasta dishes change frequently and are all beautifully textured and popping with fresh fresh flavors, perfectly sauced. The antipasto are mostly light and bright; I have no idea how they source such extraordinary ingredients in the dead of winter. And the primi & secondi are all prepared so perfectly (so far) - the ribeye with a light, crispy crust containing stunning fatty bursts with each bite - the lamb beautifully prepared with the most delicately fruity/minty sauce - the black cod or salmon also beautifully sauced.
Service is elegantly casual, and the selection of wine is wonderful. Cocktails are also so well prepared.
I have no idea how this place is rated only 4 stars - this place is of the caliber of Salare, Cafe Juanita, and Canlis."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Sylvia K.,"We were able to snag last minutes reservations for two on the Resy site on the day of (there was a cancellation!) at 8pm. We've been wanting to eat at Il Nido for months since it opened. The Resy site was easy to use and we got an email confirmation plus a text reminder an hour before our reservation.
We arrived a few minutes early (there's a small parking lot but we easily found street parking - Alki in winter is a lot less busy) and the host seated us right away. The historic Alki Homestead building has been beautifully restored. The interior is gorgeous and because it's December there were Christmas decorations which was lovely.
Our server Chad came over and told us the special (which was a cheese plate) and gave us some time to look over the menu. Everything on the menu sounded good. We decided on the special cheese plate (which came with a soft cheese from Cowgirl Creamery), the sage pappardelle in rabbit sugo, and the cider braised pork cheek. We asked the server to recommend a wine to go with our dinner and he suggested the arneis.
The arneis wine was lovely and paired well with our food. The cheese plate was yummy - the cheese was good and the housemade quince paste was delicious. Our pasta dish was my favorite part of the meal. The sage pappardelle was amazing and cooked perfectly. The rabbit meat was tender (and plentiful) and the sauce was light tasty. The pork cheek was also delicious and the flavor was great and the meat was also really tender (didn't even need a knife!). This polenta cake came with the pork cheek and that was super salty. Not sure if they just added too much salt or they added enough salt but didn't account for the polenta soaking up additional sauce, but it was way too salty.
Overall, the meal was delicious - the pasta and the proteins were good and the service was excellent, and the ambiance was perfect. I loved the log cabin interior and the christmas decorations. The only reason I couldn't give a full five stars was because of the overly salty polenta cake. For the prices and for the difficulty of getting reservations, I would expect all the food to be perfect. I'll definitely come back for the pasta (if we can somehow get reservations again)!"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Luke B.,Really cool set up and great food. Only down side was the wait times. You can get a drink from the bar quickly but food takes about 45 minutes. This isn't a problem if you are no rush and can have a few drinks while waiting. Would recommend to anyone visiting the area and will go back again
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Marie B.,"I am behind in my Yelp reviews coming up on one year, however, despite that sleep eludes me, I am compelled to post a Yelp review for Il Nido (10/9/19).
Big fan of pretty much whatever project Chef Mike Easton, his wife Victoria, and their team are involved in....from the early days of Bizarro, Lecosho, and when Il Corvo was sharing space with a gelato shop at the Pike Place Market Hillclimb. Well before those infamous weekday lines on James between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.
Since I'm a northender and work way up in North Lynnwood for 4.5 years, it is rare to have that amazing bowl of pasta, that kale salad, the proscuitto/pickled celery plate, selection of olives, and/or the delicious shortbread cookies from Il Corvo.
There are plenty of other worthy sites all over the city, but with traffic, parking, budget, and other logistics, sometimes having amazing hand crafted pasta takes major strategic planning.
I was among the masses awaiting the restoration of the Alki Homestead and the opening of Il Nido. Wasn't among the first to dine in mid May though and regretfully had to cancel a reservation in June. Then to learn it's booked a month or so out, are you f-ing kidding me?
Spring and summer flies by. Autumn is well underway with the colorful foliage and brisk breeze.
On a whim, turned my attention to the Resy site yesterday to see if I can nail a unicorn reservation to Il Nido. I literally had to blink in disbelief at six available slots for today. Time to check it out, and see why Yelp reviews run the entire spectrum, and why the wide disparity?
I left my home with a two hour cushion to make that trek to West Seattle. Not bad, in 30 minutes I was exiting off the bridge onto Harbor Avenue. Beautiful views of the water and the downtown Seattle skyline, I periodically stopped to admire and photograph. Located Il Nido (see posted tip) and a parking space right out front, then basked in the sun.
They don't unlock the main entrance until 5pm sharp. So I had an opportunity to admire the building exterior and well kept garden beds, plus chat with a trio of other women seated at the front bench. More folks also started appearing on the porch. Nice and orderly we all entered, thankfully no Black Friday-like pushing and shoving.
Once inside taking it all in, very aesthetically pleasing, and an amazing interior restoration. I had a brief flashback to two Willows Inn visits with the similarities of welcoming warmth, natural light, and lots of focal points.
Checked in at the host stand and was promptly brought to a two top, where I was taken care of by Chad and his other Il Nido colleagues. I was pleased to learn that the seasonal menu recently had changed, but passed on this evening's special of rabbit. ""Thumper"" at Cafe Juanita nearly two decades ago still gives me PTSD.
So here's the run down of what I indulged in:
*Rubicon ($14) Bourbon, black walnut bitters, fig sugar, on the rocks. Nice strong and smooth cocktail.
*Contorni ($11) Mixed chicories salad with anchovy dressing, perfectly soft boiled egg, and copious parmigiano atop. Wish the greens weren't quite so cold temperature wise, but ate about a third with the egg. Kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Primi Pasta ($24) Lumache, winter squash cream, crisp fried sage, and cookie dust. Delicious seasonal pasta. This is where others balk at either the pasta prices, quantity, or both. I ate half with all the sage leaves. Again, kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Secondi Bistecca Ribeye ($49) requested medium rare and served atop tender salad greens. The juices on the greens were spot on tasty. I was blown away by the quality, preparation, and presentation of the ribeye steak. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, tender...barely didn't need the steak knife provided. Again, ate half with all the salad greens. Yes, another box filled.
*Savored the ribeye with a glass of 2016 Avennia Gravura ($16/glass) a full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc from Columbia Valley. The pour definitely complemented the steak.
*For dessert, Espresso with biscotti ($3) and the Chocolate Salami dessert special ($10) added the exclamation point to my dinner. Slices of chocolate speckled with ladyfingers to mimic the salami, served in addition with hazelnut brittle, plum and apple slices, and a berry compote. Nicely composed, not cloying, and terrific flavors and textures.
I enjoyed my brief exchanges with the wait staff throughout my meal and the host staff upon departing. I dined alone, but was well attended to and the entire meal was well paced.
Il Nido is an impressive neighborhood gem, fresh seasonal items showcased from local purveyors, spot on professional service, contributing to an overall, thoroughly enjoyable dining experience."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Huong L.,"I was super excited about this place when i first heard about it. I even woke up at like 3am to try to get reservations... I guess my expectation was too high that it was kind of a let down...
The place itself is very rustic and homey so it was a mix between being casual and fancy.
As you get seated, your server comes over to explain the menu as it change frequently, which is nice. We ended up getting following:
the special of the day which is a papadel noodle with a rabbit ragu - the pasta here is the same as il corvo - perfectly cooked, great flavors, but 2-3x more expensive than il corvo...
the quail wrapped with bacon - this was a very well balanced dish, the quail wrapped in bacon was cooked perfectly, and it was savory and rich, which was balanced out by some vibrant greens and plums.
braised green dish - did not expect this dish to be so southern style. It was kinda heavy and more beans than braised green, also kinda bland.
Poached pear in red wine with crumble - pretty good. You get a nice surprise when you cut the pear open as it is filled with cream. Also very light and not super sweet.
In summary, the food was ok, some good, some ok, but nothing extraordinary. The pasta was perfect but I rather wait at il corvo as it is cheaper and you can get more options. The wait for food here was almost as long which confuse me because they have an idea of how many people will be here through reservation so I don't know why it took so long for food to come out (it took almost 30 minutes for our dessert!)
The highlight of my meal??? The little biscotti sample they gave at the very end. It was probably the best biscotti I ever eaten. But they gave us 1.5 bitr pieces for 2 people...not sure what that is about either .."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Julie P.,"Great atmosphere, good service & delicious food! I'm a fan!
Everything we tried here was very good but the only thing that was a little disappointing was the portion was a bit lacking compared to other Italian restaurants, especially because it is on the pricier side.
We got the Castelvetrano Foccacia Bread to start off (unfortunately, bread does not come with the meal hahah) but man, it was worth paying for it because it was delicious.
We also tried the Rigatoni Nero & the Wild Boar Tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was cooked to perfection! It was so good - I think this was my favorite dish! The Rigatoni Nero lacked sauce - the pasta was a bit dry, but I did like that there was a lot of octopus in the dish. The Wood-grilled Saddle of Lamb was really yummy but it was pretty small! Haha I must have been super hungry. We finished our meal with Tiramisu dessert! My all time favorite and it did not disappoint!
Overall, I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place at least once! I will definitely come back for special occasions - IF we can get a reservation! They book out months in advance... We got super lucky and came here on the week of their opening because my friend ending up giving me her reservation! :) Thanks Il Nido - we had a great experience here."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Rebecca T.,"My boyfriend was able to snag us a table at il Nido the day of after waiting on the waitlist for a while- so don't give up!!
I am a huge fan of il corvo so of course when I heard about il nido opening up, I desperately needed to try it! The menu seemed to have rotated recently so I have the updated menu below!
For starters we ordered the chicories salad and bruschetta al lardo. Both were absolutely delicious! Fair warning, the chicories salad was pretty bitter so if you don't like bitter tastes don't get it! The bruschetta was sooo good. The bread was very fresh & the butter was so creamy!
For pastas, we ordered the rigatoni with braiseed beef & the bucatini with pork. The pasta was cooked very al dente just like how they do it over at il corvo. The beef sauce was pretty heavy and packed full of flavors. There were big beef chunks in it too! The bucatini had little pork pieces and was definitely a lot less strong but still very flavorful as well. I'm glad I was able to have a little of both for some balance. The pasta portions were the same as il corvo's!
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was pretty good (nothing special though!)"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Silvia V.,"Amazing place!!
Reservation recommended if you want to sit in the restaurant or there is a small bar for 2-people party. Without reservation you may have to wait for a while.
The food: delicate, flavorful, and beautiful! We had wine and a full menu with appetizers, entrees (lamb and pasta), dessert and coffee. Really great!
Service: impeccable! Friendly host and nice waiter.
Price: totally appropriate for the quality you get. It is on the fancy date side but definitely worth every penny!
Atmosphere: calm and perfect for conversations!
Just an outstanding place and a gem in the area!!
Thanks for the beautiful experience!
Silvia & Joel"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Robyn C.,"Went here for opening night with high expectations. I knew the pasta was going to be great, but I had one question... is it worth it? Yes. The service was great. Our server actually engaged with us about the menu rather than just telling us ""the special"" and the usual ""thanks for joining us"".
Small menu but, the dishes were well executed.
The octopus rigatoni was 5/5!! A heaping portion of baby octopus, pasta and oh man- the spices. I try not order squid, octopus or even scallops at restaurants because it tends to be over cooked, but I'm really glad I gave it a go! Also tried the trout. The olives and the fennel really enhanced the flavor of the fish.
Then came the tiramisu. It wasn't as ""soaked"" as I would've liked, which made the flavor more like just any other ""coffee cake"". I wasn't so sure about the chocolate garnish because it just ended up bigger than the actual tiramisu... was it supposed to be a shell? I'm not sure.
All in all, it was good food. The ocean view near by isn't so bad either."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Parisa E.,"Il Nido is truly what an Italian experience should be! Cozy, fresh, and wanting more!
Getting reservations are tough (1 month in advance and opens at midnight). Once you dine there the hostess will ask if you want to make more reservations so we made 2 more 3-4 months in advance. I thought this was a really nice touch making them value their customers!
Food was amazing and pasta was cooked perfectly! I was really surprised and amazed by the desert both the taste and presentation! The log cabin is so cozy and perfect for a night out!"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Joline T.,"TL;DR Chef makes the simple things shine
Reservations: Seriously prohibitive and a pain. Reservations are open 30 days at a time. Reservations open at midnight. Had to book a month out at 12:01 am.
Parking: There's a lot right next door to the building. Signs will say parking for Homestead only; that's for Il Nido at the Homestead.
Burrata and prosciutto: Burrata was incredibly fresh and light, prosciutto was beautifully delicate and perfectly salty paired with the fresh burrata. Hands down the best prosciutto I've ever had.
Tagliatelle with bolognese: Tagliatelle was a little more al dente than I've had at other places; I loved the chew. I hate to compare it to Il Corvo, but how do you not? I also haven't been to Il Corvo for a couple years now because the line is impossible now. Based on my v distant memory, Il Corvo was just as good for half the price. But since I can't get Il Corvo anymore, then I'll pay for chef's pasta at Il Nido.
Cauliflower steak: it was fine. Gorgonzola was an interesting pairing that I've never had before. Gorgonzola wasn't overwhelming, but it was too much for me. That's a very personal taste thing though.
Pork cheeks with dried pear slices and polenta: Pork cheeks were didnt-need-a-fork tender. The sweetness of the pear complemented the earthiness of the pork cheeks. The polenta was the best I ever had. Crispy on the outside, fluffy soft the inside. Nice cheese flavor without being cheesy.
Would def come back!"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Emily J.,"When the reservations opened for Il Nido, I immediately jumped on resy to book for a weekend night. Looking back on it, I am glad I did because when I was debating moving it, all the reservations for June were taken.
Having been to Il Corvo one time before, I kinda knew what I was getting myself into by going here. If you are unfamiliar with their style, which I assume you aren't since you are on their yelp page, you now know what type of menu they have and what their dishes look like.
The prices are not low. I would not come here on a budget or thinking you are going to get quantity or quality. You are going here for the quality.
Reviewing the menu, each dish seems thoughtfully put together and you can see that in the presentation as each of your items gets placed onto your table.
For my date night, we started off with a drink. I asked for a fruity suggestion and ended up ordering the Cool Waves. It was definitely fruity, somewhat strong, and very tasty.
For the appetizer, we ordered the burrata and the 24 month prosciutto. If you have never had a burrata before, it is a fresh Italian milk cheese. When you see it, you probably are thinking rich and dense but it is actually what I would consider light, clean, and subtle. A very delicate flavor in my opinion. If you cannot handle dairy or are not a fan of milk, maybe skip it, otherwise I would recommend. The prosciutto was kinda gamey? A unique taste and little on the salty side.
The main course items we chose were the ricotta cavatieddi, roman style pomodoro and the wood grilled saddle lamb, corona beans, charred spring onions, peas. I, obviously, chose the pasta. It was exactly what I was expecting. Really good and I could of ate a huge portion of it. It was the perfect size if you had an appetizer before. If you did not, you would probably consider it small. The wood grilled saddle lamb was delicious. It melt in your mouth and had great flavor. The beans on the other hand, were just okay.
Overall, the meal was good but pricey. If you need to eat a ton, be ready to open up your wallet. Would I go back? Definitely! But only if other people wanted to go.
Parking - They do have a few spaces on the left, if you are driving by and facing the restaurant. They seem like they are normally open if you have either the 5pm or 5:30 pm reservation. If you have a later reservation, fingers crossed that you get a spot or else you get the joy of driving around alkai looking for street parking."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Julia C.,"We were so excited to get a reservation here because of all the hype.
A little underwhelmed, nothing was bad but wouldn't say anything was amazing either. Pastas were all cooked perfectly, the bucatini was definitely our favorite dish. I would say it is worth checking out as I believe their dishes change continuously based on the seasons. Glad we came and tried Il Nido, it was worth the trek to West Seattle ;)"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Eating C.,"Came here on a Wednesday night with the wife and where completely blown away. We started with the bruschetta which was different and flavorful and done perfectly. I had the pork chop which was a special and it was amazing. It was smoky and flavorful. It was served with chard broccolini I think that had a sweet vinegar flavor to it which was a revelation. For dessert I got the olive oil cake and a cappuccino. Cake was moist and delicious and the cap was well balanced. The food was amazing but the highlight of the experience was the friendly and knowledgeable staff. Chad our server was amazing but overall everyone was just top notch. We will be back, this is our new favorite restaurant in Alki Beach. I can't wait to try everything on the menu. Thank you so"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Audrey C.,"I cannot believe how difficult it was to get reservations here... I literally had to check back almost every day to see if anyone had cancelled and it still took a couple weeks. In the end we had a great experience and the food was delicious, but definitely on the pricier side for West Seattle. That said, given how busy this place is, I think there is plenty of demand for a littler pricier dining in West Seattle. I mean, how many more pizza places do we need?
We ordered a bottle of wine, two drinks, two pastas, burrata & 24 month prosciutto, focaccia, lamb, and tiramisu, and that was plenty and bit overkill for the two of us. But if you wait for that long to try a place, you might as well try as much as you can. I think our bill ended up being $260 including tip, so I would put it on the special occasion list or a couple times a year list. There are some lower priced Italian options in West Seattle that offer some pretty decent handmade pasta as well, but this place seemed like a level above and the service was really good.
Overall, will definitely be back to try it out again once things have died down a bit and reservations are easier.
Note- there is a bar which I assume is walk-up and you can order off their main menu, but can't confirm. There were a limited number of seats at the bar, maybe 8-10"
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Tuan N.,"I'll preface this by saying it's more like 3.5*
We've been waiting for this place to open up seeing how much we loved Il Corvo, but tough to make it there only during lunches.
With Il Nido open for dinner, we can have more of a chance to have delicious pasta.
First off the building, decor was welcoming like a home and service was on point from the greet to sit down. Our server was honest about the food and gave suggestions about what he thought were the stars and which dishes might needs to be tweaked.
We had the bruschetta, king oyster mushroom, and two different pasta and a couple of drinks.
The bruschetta came with a lard spread that was delicious but the bread was so burnt, they actually took it off our bill and gave us focaccia bread.
The mushroom dish was a great appetizer with right amount of saltiness and earthiness. This restored my thought that it's going to be a great meal.
However, when the two pasta dish came out it was a tale of two pasta. The gemelli sauce was great but the pasta itself a bit overcooked and fell apart. The cavadetti texture was perfect but sauce could have used a bit more salt. Some small changes would have made them perfect like I'm used at at Il Corvo. Also, the portions were on a smaller side even for fine dining.
Overall, they just opened not so long ago so hopefully they work out the small missteps by the time we dine there again."
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,Laura C.,"A bit of a let down compared to Il Corvo. In general, expectations were very high coming to this restaurant hoping the pasta would be the same as their lunch spot.
The meal was quite unmemorable, but I remember the dishes being very small and the pastas not living up to what they serve at Il Corvo. For what you pay in price, I would expect a bit more from Il Nido."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Lee S.,"These folks are amazing. The food is great and it feels like home cooking. I hope they can survive the COVID chaos (along with the rest of us), and I'll be patronizing them as long as they're able to stay open. As aside the interior refit from the old Pizza Hut was not the most elegant for those that have design sensitivities so takeout perhaps better for that crowd. I for one will look forward to dining in with the Rat Pack soundtrack in the air."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Julia A.,"My favorite cuisine is Italian food so my husband and I like to venture out to try all the Italian restaurants there are in Seattle. This restaurant is in a really hidden location (it's the right most business in the plaza) and there's no well lit/big sign at all in the front to help you locate the restaurant as you drive here. But note that the small parking lot IS available to park at when you eat here!
We ordered the Bruschetta to start - lovely! It contained lots of tomatoes so that was a very pleasant start. For dinner, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Lasagna. When you order your entrees....order one between two people. Don't say I didn't warn you!! The portion size is GINORMOUS (see pics) and you definitely want to leave room for dessert. Unless you want lots of leftovers (I mean that is not a bad thing), then split an entree. :P The actual entrees were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert, we ordered the Canoli - light and YUMMY!! We were disappointed there wasn't Panna Cotta on the dessert menu but we got over that pretty quickly. :P
Highly recommend trying this restaurant! It's a hidden gem. :)"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Stacy S.,"Had dinner from here last night... thanks to a post on Next Door sharing that they would do take-out or delivery. The one employee taking orders was great - nice and welcoming, and graciously answered all of our questions.
Our food took slightly longer than they said it would, which was understandable since the phone kept ringing with people placing orders.
The food was good... I highly recommend their farro salad. It was delicious! The arancini were good and a decent size - just not my favorite dish. The marinara that came with them had good seasoning. Porky's pizza was good - with a fluffy crust (again, good - just not a favorite.) The Basilico pasta was great... it wasn't as warm when I got home, but still tasty.
I'll dine and/or order out from here again - and will probably order that farro salad every time I do so!"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Uthara M.,"Didn't like the food or service here. Have had Italian in multiple restaurants over the years, but this was by far one of the worst experiences in dining I've had. A girlfriend and I went here for dinner. At first the waiter was very polite and courteous and brought back our drinks and appetizer promptly. The appetizer was okay- I was eager to try out their entrees based on all the great reviews I had read about the place. I asked if they had a mushroom/veg risotto as I really love risotto but only a seafood risotto was on their menu. They obliged even though it wasn't on the menu. The outcome however, was a bad excuse for risotto with 3 mushrooms on it for garnishing. The texture, taste and consistency of the dish was just bad.
When I told the waiter that it was pretty bland, he offered me some seasoning. I was pretty sure that no amount of pepper and chili flakes was going to help that dish, it was just too bad but I did try anyway.
I asked if he could bring me another entree at which he snapped and said- I asked for mushroom risotto and so I should eat it and that he can't keep switching my entrees till I like one. Needless to say, I lost my appetite then n there.
At the end, when the check came- he didn't charge for the risotto. However, that was too little too late for me and I most definitely wouldn't be returning here."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Cindy I.,"Wish it had nicer atmosphere in the restaurant but it's full of old school fluorescent lights dimmed with decorative covers. So we took the food to go. The chicken Marsala was more bland than we like. We both felt the chicken Parmesan was very good and would go back for that again. Meatballs and spaghetti was a meal we would order again too.
Don't forget the garlic knots are great!"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Clay B.,"What a wonderful place to sit and have delicious homemade Italian food, we were waited on by the chef.
She makes everything in house and wonderful! Higher recommend the Lamb Ragout sandwich, the lunch menu is small, but they have a much larger menu for dinner that starts at 4pm. Lunch is from 11:am- 2:00pm, get there early as it is a small restaurant but very nice."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Jennifer T.,"Came here last Friday with a friend and we indulged in the ""Family Style"" meal, where you choose what you pay (suggested $20-50 pp) and the chef curates a multi-course dinner for the table. Per our server's recommendation, we did $35 to bring us from appetizer to dessert, and this was no joke best $35 I've ever spent at a restaurant!! The quantity and quality of food served here would have easily been $60+ pp at other restaurants. So happy I've found this hidden gem!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great value, authentic Italian comfort food.
More on the food:
- Appetizer (5/5...peep my photo to see the full spread!!): A few of my favorites were the caesar salad w/ crab meat, steamed clams in white wine, deep fried gnocchi, tomatoes & burrata, and toasted baguette w/ this amaaazing pistachio spread. I probably could've been full off just the first course! But of course, I paced myself in anticipation for the other dishes... :)
- Pesto tortellini with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes (5/5): This was easily the most decadent and well-made tortellini I've ever had! The pasta itself had the perfect amount of bite/chewiness, the pesto was so fresh/aromatic, and the creamy goat cheese + the sweet-tartness of the sun-dried tomato made every bite taste like a little piece of heaven. I'm typically not blown away by tortellini but this dish packed so much flavor!
- Steak w/ roasted asparagus (4/5): The steak cut like butter and the asparagus was perfectly roasted and seasoned...it was a simple dish but was cooked really well and complemented the bold flavors in our other courses. Dessert:
- Cheesecake w/ chocolate salami (4/5): Loved how the cheesecake was so fluffy/light! Also enjoyed nibbling on the salami-shaped dark chocolates pieces with walnuts.
Our server was super helpful and friendly -- he consistently went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our food and our water cups were never empty. The restaurant itself is modestly sized and modestly decorated...the ambiance is nothing to write home about, but the incredible food, service, and value made Aglio E Olio a 5/5 experience for me!"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Megha B.,"This is one of my favorite hole in the wall restaurant in Seattle.
The food is very authentic and amazing. I love the garlic knots, spaghetti aglio e olio, harvest gnocchi and the pizza. The house red is usually pretty decent.
I like the server and manager at this restaurant, they are both really friendly and it's always a great time dining here.
I will continue eating here!"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Kathy A.,"I definitely found my new favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle! This place is perfect. You would never notice it from the street view and when you walk in you're immediately thinking ""wait? really? this place does good italian food?"" It is a quintessential hole in the wall restaurant without any bells and whistles on ambiance but the food and service far exceed expectations! Portions are large and the price points are hard to beat. The farro salad is massive and has huge chunks of goat cheese. Quite tasty! The arancini are hearty and topped with plenty of tomato sauce. The harvest gnocchi was divine! Rich, cheesy but still a nice light pasta dish. Our server was lovely as well and the food came out rather quick! I can't wait to return!"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Jon H.,"So far this is my favorite Italian place in the city. The bruschetta is delicious, as is the parm and practically anything you can order!
My advice: come early in the day before the evening rush or call in a reservation, the restaurant is very small and fills up quickly (literally maybe 5 or 6 tables)"
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Jeff B.,"4.5 stars.
What a surprise. Our son wanted to have birthday dinner here, so the five of us went on a Saturday evening.
FOOD: 4.5 stars. We had $35 per person dinner, leaving the chef to decide the contents. This included for the vegan among us. Excellent value. Several appetizers (green salad, cold cuts, olives, mozzarella, bruschetta, artichokes, etc), pasta meat dish, lamb chops (and equivalents for the vegan). Followed by dessert. The bday boy received a free tiramisu - heavenly; the rest of us had chocolate gelato with fruit - excellent!
We also had a carafe of house red wine from Montepulciano.
SERVICE: 5.0 stars. The gentleman and lady servers worked hard to ensure we were very satisfied.
AMBIANCE: 4.0 stars. Nicely done, attractive (yet simple) interior.
TIP: Make reservations, at least for a Sat evening. They were fully booked the evening we dined. Quite a few people came in for take-out."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Jim P.,"Oh My!
Came for lunch, and if you blink you may drive right past this place. Nothing fancy about the building or the interior for that matter (never mind the greasy floors) but man they can put out some dang nice foods.
We had the porchetta sandwich, the mortadella sandwich, rigatoni bowl, and an alfredo bowl (with porchetta). The sandwiches are huge, great bread, fillings super hot and plentiful. I also love the gardenia mix.
The pastas come with ceasar salad and I garlic knot that you wish you had about a dozen more of.
Prices are very reasonable, now if I could only convince them to open a place in West Seattle my live would be complete."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,S S.,"This place is a gem. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is among the best Italian in the city. I don't come here as often as I would like because, well, weight. I always eat waaaayyyyy too much when I'm here. The hole in the wall aspect is nice and cozy, but I do wish they had an upmarket version as well so I could come here as a night out.
Also, I wish they would deliver with someone other than Bite Squad."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Nikhil T.,This is a hidden gem. One of the handful places in Seattle that can serve a delicious main course under $20. We have been here twice and both times found the food to be delicious and the portion sizes large (you're guaranteed to have leftovers). The olive oil and fresh bread is heavenly. The pesto pasta is great as well. The music and decor is quirky Italian. The server is fantastic to talk to.
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Travis G.,"I am so happy to be so close to this place! There are a ton of great items on the menu, but I keep going back to the strip steak with the gorgonzola gnocchi. So good and a great price. Also, the bruschetta is a standout. But really everything I've had is good - we've tried nearly every item on the menu."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,AJ A.,"Had the mortadella and fried egg sandwich for lunch. DELICIOUS!
Quaint, lots of personality. Hidden away in the back of a tiny collection of ground floor shops. It's actually around the corner and in back."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Kevin L.,"This is my hands-down favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I live in Capitol Hill and the Italian places are nice, but they're a bit upscale and hit or miss as they try out the hottest and hippest ingredients on the market.
Aglio e Olio, however, I found randomly when I decided I needed a bite to eat and was in the area. It's a small intimate restaurant and I was thinking: ""Sigh, whatever. At least I can just get pasta or something.""
Wow. This place has hands down my favorite meatballs I've ever had in my entire life. They're huge, and they taste AMAZING. I've been going back more frequently now, and I also have to recommend the Calamari. It's not deep-fried, it's not crispy, but instead it's this AMAZING pan-seared quality. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and try the Calamari. Ridiculously good!
Anyways. I didn't realize I was coming into a wonderful small family-style and family-tasting Italian restaurant until I tasted the food, and at that point I realized I was in a good place.
I love you, Aglio e Olio! I hope you stay here for a very long time."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Rahul D.,"Against my selfish desire to keep this place secret, I'm writing a public review of this place.
I have been here several times with varying party sizes and types (2, 4, 10, some vegetarians, some pescatarians, typical omnivores, etc.), for my birthday, parents' birthday, going-away parties, date nights, etc.
I have had the family-style serving every time (35 for antipasti, pasta, meat, and dessert!!). The staff is excellent at accommodating dietary restrictions that vary throughout the party, and their choices always satisfy.
The quality is always excellent, the service is always great, the drinks are always smooth and well-priced, and the value is always incredible.
I hope you all get to enjoy this small restaurant, be sure to reserve ahead of time due to limited seating."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Raymond T.,"We came in for lunch looking for the Italian meal which was kinda like a pay what you will and we'll serve you what you pay. It was only a dinner thing but he agreed to it and said '35 will bring you through dessert is that okay?"". It was a little pricey for lunch and my friend couldn't eat any pork or beef but -spoiler alert- it was well worth the money.
Our first course was an antipasto variety of burrata, fried gnocchi, anchovies, pickled vegis, crab salad , bruschetta and vongole clams. Everything was super tasty and I especially enjoyed the burrata and fried gnocchi.
Our main course was a full serving of halibut over lemon risotto and a pesto pasta with assorted vegis. Could've used a little more salt but it was still good. We couldn't finish the entrees despite coming hungry.
For dessert we had chocolate salami with nuts and fresh berries. And no there was no meat in this salami.
Overall all this food at any other restaurant could've cost well over 100$. It's minus a star because the atmosphere was small and could be improved and the service a little slow."
Aglio e Olio,(206) 709-8883,Mindful M.,"Absolute hidden gem. Every time we come I'm stunned at how good the food is for the price, and how laid back it is! Non-pretentious, incredible homemade and authentic food, cozy atmosphere. I'm always shocked this place isn't packed any time we come in, but on the rare occasion it is they're always happy to suggest takeout which is just as nice."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Alan M.,"Always among our favorite Italians. Recently tried their takeout. Restricted menu, still terrific. Had wild boar and shrimp wrapped with pancetta, both delicious. Ordered the day before for 5:30p Friday pickup. Delivered to my car within 5 minutes of calling to announce my arrival."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Rachel G.,"I love La Rustica. I use to eat there all the time... I was so happy to see that they still do take out! Their food is always amazing. The best part is when I go to pick up my food , they are always so welcoming. Nice to have a local restaurant I love still deliver great service and food
-Thank you La Rustica!"
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Madison L.,"This place! It gave me all the feels. Small, intimate, authentic Italian restaurant, YES PLEASE!
The focaccia as the starter is absolutely delicious! Incredibly light and fluffy with the perfect amount of garlic. I could have had that as my meal
I got the gnocchi with cream sauce. 10/10. I'm still raging about it. Enough for 2 meals. It's so fresh and creamy I was so happy with my meal
My partner got the seafood linguini and raves about it
We finished with the lemoncello tiramisu which was fantastic!
Our service was attentive and relatively fast.
If you want an unforgettable Italian experience La Rustica is the place for you. I'll be spending all my special occasion dinners here. I can't even explain how much I enjoyed my whole experience"
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Kira T.,"Delightful. Cozy and intimate, with excellent service. The location is quite special - right across from tiny Weather Watch Park in West Seattle, with its breathtaking, glorious views.
The lamb shank special was ""to die for"" according to my friend who ordered it (I don't eat meat). My penne puttanesca was spicy and bracing and packed with flavor. We shared bruschetta and a caprese salad that featured superbly fresh, amazing mozzarella (although the tomatoes were a bit pallid... I blame the time of year). A couple of our party ordered pizzas. One pronounced his ""just fine"" and the other (my husband) thought his was flavorful, but ""too bready."" He's from NYC, so he likes a verrrry thin crust.
Dessert was amazing: the four of us shared a regular and a limoncello tiramisu. Both were HUGE. Both were tender and fluffy and delightful, and neither were cloyingly sweet. The flavor of the liqueur and cream shone through.
WARNING: do not trust the prices posted online! Most items on the menu were between one dollar and four dollars MORE than the online price. We still got out of there for $250 bucks for 4 of us - including 1 1/2 carafes of their decent house Montepulciano and tip - but we were expecting it to be a tad less.
That said, I would return."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Kristin B.,"It is a small hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss, but is sooo worth it. The food is among the best Italian food in the city. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new or off the radar.
I had the chicken parmigiana and a caesar salad. Both were delicious. The chicken parm was perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was amazing and tasty. The serving sizes were ample and more than enough for a single person.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
Accessibility: This is a very small restaurant and it is not too accessible. The washrooms are up a step or two and squeezed in a corner. The tables are all squeezed together. There is no room to sit and wait for a table. The good news is it is all tables and chairs. If you are able to work with a tight squeeze and a place that can get noisy because of the smallness of the space, then you're good to go."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Lexi H.,"West Seattle institution with family-owned environment and hearty Italian classics.
The restaurant is located in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking right in Alki. La Rustica is quaint with some old-world Italian decor and white tablecloths - really what you envision when you think ""family-owned Italian restaurant"" so I was into it.
We arrived with a large party for a birthday (reservations made). For a Wednesday evening, it was very busy so I would recommend making reservations. The space is not big (inside or out on the patio), so I don't think they host large parties often. They sat us quickly, and started taking drink orders. They almost immediately brought us water and bread.
After taking our food order, service seemed to slow a bit. We had a late attendee, and they were not acknowledged until we finally caught our server's attention after 15 minutes. It was difficult as the service was great up until this point, and we seemed to have lost our server between ordering food and receiving food.
When the food arrived (which did take a while, but it was a big party and I won't dock points for that), I had to leave for an appointment so I got my pasta to go. I had ordered their squid ink pasta special. It was alright, but I'll likely get something else next time (everything else looked amazing). It was described to have a marinara/alfredo creamy sauce and the sauce didn't seem creamy to me, so I think I may have had different expectations - it was a very large portion, the pasta itself was good, and it had lots of seafood in it. The pastas are also served with a dinner salad - the homemade dressing on those were AWESOME - very garlicky and generously topped.
They serve wine by the carafe for a good price, and the food menu is large enough to give plenty of variety. I will definitely be coming back, this time with a much smaller party, to try out some of the other pastas that looked decadent and have a more intimate experience. I imagine that my star rating will go up after going with a smaller group.
Note: they can't split the check but can take up to 3 payments on a check, so keep it in mind if you're with a big group."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Jan C.,"Although there are some positives about our experience here, we will not return.
Pros: Our server, Nadia, was very personable and helpful.
The antipasto mista plate was huge. Good vairety of meats, but only one kind of cheese.
Setting is very nice
Cons: The noise level is not conducive to a pleasant experience. I used my phone to check the decibel level and it was pretty steady at 80 db with times up to 87 db. Not fun!
While the wait staff was pleasant there were apparently not enough of them as there was a lot of waiting for water, etc.
The food was underwhelming. In particular, the carbonara was dry to the point of having very little flavor. I am a carbonara fan and I don't want it to be soaking in sauce, but there was almost no sauce at all on this dish.
Parking is difficult to find during the dinner hour."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Sheila G.,"I wanted to love this place, and I did, until later that night when I got sick from the food!
The restaurant is so beautiful if you sit on the patio. The food is really good. But I wouldn't eat there after what I experienced after, they definitely served me some bad food.
Plenty of people have been there without getting sick, but plenty of people have gotten sick too. Go at your own risk!"
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Aleksandr F.,Not sure about how is food here. We did not have a chance to try it. Came to this restaurant in 15 minutes after opening but owner told us that no free tables for us and we need to wait 20-30 minutes for it. We've waited about 1 hour but couldn't wait more and came out hungry. So book table before you going to come here.
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Jamie E.,"Still after all these years, my absolute favorite restaurant of all time. The Chicken Parmesan is the best ever!"
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Jessica R.,"Best pasta spot in West Seattle, hands down! This spot is a tiny little spot on the west/south part of Alki, and definitely worth making the trip.
We have come here several times now, and most recently for my birthday. We had a group of 12 and they were very accommodating to have such a large group in such a small space. This time I got the rigatoni con ricotta, and that is probably one of my favorite dishes here. It's a rigatoni noodle with white sauce, cheese, onions, and pancetta.
They also brought me a birthday tiramisu! Overall love this place and will definitely be coming back!"
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Teresa G.,Would never imagine that such a gem was behind the deceiving exterior. The food is prepared with care and will not disappoint. The atmosphere is warm and intimate and the staff and owner are simply the best.
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Daphne B.,"Do not go here for takeout unless you want to be exposed to too many people and screamed at by a stressed employee. They are begging the neighborhood to help support them during the virus. I can't believe how unsafe, unsanitary, and unprofessional this experience was tonight. As a long time West Seattle resident, I was appalled by this experience. After being crowded into this tiny place, watching an obviously disturbed staff member run around and check out on credit cards, this person started screaming at me ""I'm stressed, back off"" at the top of his lungs at me after telling me they didn't have my order. La Rustica should not ethically be operating in such a manner. This poor employee lost it. I will never return."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,M T.,"My husband and I came here for a date night and it did not disappoint! We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait!
I had the lasagna and it was delicious and so hearty, everything pasta should be! My husband had the chicken parmigiana and loved it. We wrapped up the night with the tiramisu, which was just delightful! The meal overall was delicious and the service was great. Food was the closest we've had to pasta we had on our honeymoon in Italy.
Come here and enjoy!!! The wait is worth the amazing food you get and the ambiance."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Michelle L.,Really cute place tucked away on Alki Beach. I don't know why there's so many bad reviews on service our server was super pleasant. Loved their garlic bread and salad - but next time I would skip appetizers only because you can't NOT eat a decent amount of garlic bread which fills you up. By the time our main courses came out I was like 60% full haha! I thought their full carafe of house cab sav for $38 was quite reasonable. Loved the bolognese pasta and my husband's lasagna was great too! Would definitely come back for sureee!
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Elisabeth P.,"We were lucky enough to snag a table at this happening place on a perfect Seattle Saturday evening. We'd actually had reservations at a different restaurant to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary, but were unable to eat due to their inflexibility with my food allergy. The husband searched restaurants near us offering gf menu items and we discovered La Rustica.
Located down near the water, it has a beautiful view from the patio. Parking was a little tricky, but we enjoyed the walk along the water to and from our car. This family owned place is about as authentic as it gets. With the owner greeting guests and standing outside beckoning passerbys into his establishment, family as servers, and family in the kitchen, you immediately start to get in the mood for a home cooked meal.
We were put on a waiting list for the busy Saturday night rush, but it moved quickly and we were seated outside on the little covered patio with hanging plants and a gorgeous view of the water. Our server stopped by and took our order. Not only was she able to point out their gf items, she also assured me they'd prep my food with allergy precautions, oooo yah bring me allll the pasta.
They have a great selection of gf items to choose from. We started with their house salad which was simplistic yet incredibly fresh and delicious. I went for the gf penne with ricotta which was basically a creamy cheesy bunch of goodness. The husband loved the manicotti he ordered and had nothing left to take home.
We stopped back again just recently and had another perfect dining experience. The husband got the gnocchi and I had the gf penne with a creamy tomato sauce and beef filet. We finished with a decadent chocolate gf cake..There was not a crumb remaining on our plates.
With delicious authentic Italian cuisine at a great price, excellent service, and an unbeatable view, we left fatted and happy and looking forward to our return."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Aaron F.,"We had our first meal at La Rustica. A cozy, welcoming atmosphere, similar vibe to a rustic country home in Tuscany. The service was excellent, courses served timely, and just the right amount of attention. The lamb gnocchi, while tender and well presented, was too heavily salted. My partner had the shrimp scampi, which we both agreed was also too salty and grilled shrimp slightly overdone. The last critique would be the cannolis we both had for dessert, which would have been a joy to my Italian grandmother had the chef decided to leave off the discordant note of raspberry drizzle. That said, the wine, coffee, appetizers, salads and service were superb. We'll try it again at some point and see how it goes."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Lex D.,"Amazing food and service. Get the wild boar you will not be disappointed. Everything is fresh and made to order. Be careful loading up on the bread, it is so delicious you'll forget you have a meal coming. Unless you get there at opening you will have to wait a while. They do not take reservations. Wish they would especially for special occasions. When being seated ask not to be seated at the table near the restroom. Awkward when people are standing waiting to pee as you try to dine..and reminds you that you are near the toilet. They really need to eliminate that table. There is a little bar in back by little I mean it accommodates about 7 to 8 very tiny space. Again if you're not there at opening your wait will be over and hour. Worth a try if you dont mind waiting."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,Cole M.,"Good Italian restaurant in West Seattle.
I am normally critical of ""Italian"" restaurants and sometimes a glance at the menu will give me an idea.
In the menu we saw, Lamb is translated into ""Pecora"" which means Sheep. Lamb is ""Agnello"". One wonders why in this modern age, people do not use a proof reader or a decent translator. In any case...
We were seated by the corner window which offers the view of the sound and sunset. We were greeted by the kind owner, and served with fresh, warm, flavorful bread. I ordered an Italian beer and my friend a red wine.
We ordered the Calamari in umido and bruschetta as antipasto followed by Fettuccine alla Carbonara and Risotto Con Salsiccia e Funghi. I found the carbonara dry and bland, I couldn't taste the guanciale, nor the egg. My friend liked his dish. We did not have room for dessert, maybe too much bread...
Judging by the various reviews this place could be a hit or a miss. My suggestion is to go, perhaps not on busy weekends.
If you're out on a date or some romantic event, the table at the corner with windows facing the West, would be the perfect place to have dinner at."
La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,R D.,"Let me start by saying that this restaurant has a gorgeous view. It's a cozy family run place that serves delicious authentic Italian food and the service was excellent too.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the owner / host and showed to our table. We started off with some complimentary home made warm bread. For appetizers we got the caprese buratta plate and mushrooms with polenta. For our mains, we had the prawns risotto and Pollo buccatini pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food was rich, but I am not complaining, it was delectable.
Against better judgement, we decided to order chocolate tort to share for dessert, and I am so glad we did. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the consistency of the tort was spot on.
Overall - delicious food, friendly service, and gorgeous view. Highly recommended!"
